                            <p>William Hesketh Lever founded the Lever Brothers, who then launched the brand. According to Unilever, the company is credited with pioneering the first less-drying soap substitute and "revolutionizing the way women cared for their skin."</p>
                            <p>Lever, a successful British soap and detergent manufacturer, was born in England in 1851.</p>
                            <p>But in the early 1900s, he was elected to the House of Commons and given the title of Lord Leverhulme. According to History, the "Hulme" portion of his name was added to honor his wife.</p>
                            <p>Prior to his entry into politics, he entered into the soap business in 1885 with the help of his brother James Darcy Lever, according to History. Lever Brothers eventually materialized after they bought a modest soap and cleaning product factory in Warrington.</p>
                            <p>The brothers partnered with a chemist from their home town by the name of William Hough Watson to create a free-lathering soap made from colonial raw product, palm oil and glycerine instead of tallow, the outlet reported.</p>
                            <p>The product was first named “Honey” before being renamed to “Sunlight Soap.” Within a decade, the soap was on sale in 134 countries, History reported.</p>
                            <p>The product “helped to popularize cleanliness and hygiene in Victorian England,” according to Unilever. It was created with the intention to "make cleanliness commonplace; to lessen work for women; to foster health and contribute to personal attractiveness, that life may be more enjoyable and rewarding for the people who use our products,” Unilever says.</p>
                            <p>Due to the scale of production, by 1887 William Lever bought a large factory in Liverpool, according to a timeline on Unilever's website. Shortly after, Lever Brothers became a limited company and expanded into Europe, America and the British colonies.</p>
                            <p>By September 1929, Margarine Unie, which was a dominant producer of margarine in the UK, and Lever Brothers signed into an agreement to create Unilever with the purpose of keeping out of each other’s principal interests, soap and margarine production. However, they ultimately decided to merge. By 1930, Unilever became a reality. Consequently, that same year Unilever’s largest rivals, Procter & Gamble, entered the UK market.</p>
                            <p>Today, that very bar is touted by Unilever as the number-one dermatologist-recommended brand within the US, Canada and France and is “strongly endorsed” by dermatologists worldwide.</p>
                            <p>By 1957, Dove launched the “revolutionary new beauty cleansing bar” in America. </p>
